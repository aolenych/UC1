## Description

This application provides an interface to a public API and fetches data in a JSON format. Designed with user efficiency in mind, it boasts features such as filtering by names, selecting based on maximum population, and pagination. This ensures that users can easily consume the specific data they're interested in, in the desired amounts. Additionally, the application's sorting capabilities make data consumption more seamless and effective, further enhancing the user experience.

## Running the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

css
Copy code

2. Navigate to the application directory:
cd <application-directory>

markdown
Copy code

3. Install the required dependencies:
npm install

markdown
Copy code

4. Run the application:
npm start

sql
Copy code

The application should now be running on your local machine, and you can access it via `http://localhost:<specified-port>`.

## Examples of Using the Endpoint

1. Fetch all data without any filters:
GET /data

kotlin
Copy code

2. Filter data by name:
GET /data?name=John

kotlin
Copy code

3. Filter data by maximum population of 1000:
GET /data?maxPopulation=1000

sql
Copy code

4. Get the second page of data with 10 items per page:
GET /data?page=2&limit=10

csharp
Copy code

5. Sort data by name in ascending order:
GET /data?sort=name&order=asc

csharp
Copy code

6. Sort data by population in descending order:
GET /data?sort=population&order=desc

csharp
Copy code

7. Filter data by name "Jane" and sort by population in ascending order:
GET /data?name=Jane&sort=population&order=asc

sql
Copy code

GET /data?maxPopulation=5000&page=3&limit=20

vbnet
Copy code

9. Get data sorted by name in descending order with a limit of 5 items:
GET /data?sort=name&order=desc&limit=5

sql
Copy code

10. Filter data by name "Alice" and get the first page with 15 items:
GET /data?name=Alice&page=1&limit=15

vbnet
Copy code

Feel free to explore other combinations of parameters to get the desired results. The application is designed to be intuitive and cater to your specific data consumption needs.
