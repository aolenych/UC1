Using .NET SDK 6 create a function that accepts a List<Countries> and a number as an attribute and can filter by Contry.Population  field. 
The filter should search for countries where the population is less than provided number from attributes in the millions of people (e.g., by providing value `10`, I should find countries with a population less than 10m)
number may be nullable, so we should add checks

Certainly! Let's first define the Country class:

csharp
Copy code
public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public long Population { get; set; }
}
Next, let's create the function that accepts a list of countries and a nullable number as an attribute to filter countries by their population.

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public static class CountryFilter
{
    public static List<Country> FilterByPopulation(List<Country> countries, int? millions = null)
    {
        if (millions == null)
            return countries;

        long populationThreshold = (long)millions * 1_000_000;
        return countries.Where(c => c.Population < populationThreshold).ToList();
    }
}

// Usage example:

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var countries = new List<Country>
        {
            new Country { Name = "CountryA", Population = 5_000_000 },
            new Country { Name = "CountryB", Population = 10_000_000 },
            new Country { Name = "CountryC", Population = 15_000_000 }
        };

        var filteredCountries = CountryFilter.FilterByPopulation(countries, 10);

        foreach (var country in filteredCountries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{country.Name} - {country.Population}");
        }
    }
}
In this example, when you run the Main function, it will output:

Copy code
CountryA - 5000000
Because CountryA is the only country in the list with a population less than 10 million.
