Using .NET SDK 6 Create pagination function:
function that accepts List<Country> and numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of Countries. The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API).

To implement pagination in a function that accepts a list of countries and a limit, you'll need to perform a couple of steps:

Model: First, ensure you have a Country class or struct to represent the country.
Function: Next, you'll create a function that takes a list of countries and a number n as parameters. This function will return the first n countries from the list.
Here's a basic example of how you can implement this:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Other properties can be added as required
}

public class CountryService
{
    public List<Country> GetFirstNCountries(List<Country> countries, int n)
    {
        return countries.Take(n).ToList();
    }
}

// Usage:
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var countries = new List<Country>
    {
        new Country { Id = 1, Name = "Country 1" },
        new Country { Id = 2, Name = "Country 2" },
        // ... Add more countries for testing ...
    };

    var service = new CountryService();
    var result = service.GetFirstNCountries(countries, 15);

    foreach (var country in result)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{country.Id}: {country.Name}");
    }
}
In this example, the GetFirstNCountries function retrieves the first n countries from the provided list using the LINQ Take extension method. You can call this function by passing the list of countries and the number 15 to retrieve the first 15 countries from the list.

If you're fetching data from an API, you'd adapt this logic in the API endpoint or service that handles fetching the data.
